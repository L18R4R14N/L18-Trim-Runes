# L18-Trim-Runes
Trim runes â€“ datapack that adds a special thematic ability to each unique engraving you apply to your armor using trims, regardless of the material (but this may change in the future). At the moment there are 16 unique customization templates in the game which create a different pattern depending on the slot used by a piece of armor, a total of 16 * 4 = 64 designs at all... Which means 64 new features added by this datapack!
